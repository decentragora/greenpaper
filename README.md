#### 8.3.2 Ongoing Distribution: The Nectar of Continuity
The Nectar of Continuity is an ongoing distribution model designed to reward ecosystem members for maintaining engagement and encouraging active participation.
i. Staking rewards: Users who stake their tokens can earn rewards, creating long-term commitment incentives.
ii. Referral programs: Encouraging users to bring new participants into the ecosystem, expanding the community and increasing network effects.
iii. Incentives for active involvement, collaboration, and contribution: Recognizing and rewarding those who contribute positively to the ecosystem's growth and development.
### 8.4 Staking and Locking Mechanisms: Hera's Bindings
Staking and locking mechanisms are essential to Decentragora's tokenomics model, encouraging long-term participation and commitment to the ecosystem.
AGT tokens
i. Stake or lock to access premium services, earn rewards, and contribute to the ecosystem's growth.
ii. The annual issuance rate for staking AGT will be determined through governance proposals, allowing for community-driven adjustments to the model over time.
DMT tokens
i. Stake or lock to participate in governance processes, enabling users to have a say in the ecosystem's future.
ii. The lock duration will range from 1 month to 2 years, with voting power increasing proportionally to the lock duration. This mechanism incentivizes long-term commitment to the platform and its governance.
### 8.5 Membership NFT: Metagora
Membership NFTs serve as a unique identifier for each participant in the Decentragora ecosystem.

The NFT is an escrow and governance vehicle that encapsulates the member's reputation and staked tokens within their Metagora Access Card.

This innovative approach allows for the following:
i. Seamlessly integrating reputation and token holdings into a single digital asset.
ii. Enhanced security and transparency in governance processes, as each participant's identity and stake get directly tied to their Metagora Access Card.
### 8.6 Economic Models and Mechanisms
Decentragora employs various economic models and mechanisms to create a dynamic and balanced ecosystem.


- Quadratic Funding 
  - A mechanism that optimizes the allocation of funds to public goods projects based on community preferences, ensuring a more equitable distribution of resources.
- Harberger Tax
  - A property tax system that encourages the efficient allocation of resources and discourages hoarding by requiring users to pay a tax based on the self-assessed value of their assets.
- Token-Curated Registries (TCR)
  - A decentralized curation system that incentivizes users to curate high-quality content, services, or other resources through token-based voting.
- Schelling Point Games
  - A coordination mechanism that incentivizes users to converge on a focal point or consensus, promoting cooperation and collaboration within the ecosystem.
- Value Flow Model
  - The value flow model is a holistic approach to understanding and optimizing the flow of value within the ecosystem, considering various factors such as incentives, network effects, and stakeholder interests.
### 8.7 Decentralized Court System (Kleros Inspired)
A sub-court of Kleros or a decentralized court system will get implemented to facilitate dispute resolution and ensure fairness within the ecosystem.
Smart contracts and token incentives will encourage honest behaviour and facilitate conflict resolution.
Community members can serve as jurors, participating in the resolution process and contributing to the overall fairness of the system.
### 8.8 Open Research and Collaboration
Decentragora encourages open research and collaboration by allocating a portion of the community treasury to fund sustainable public goods, open-source projects, infrastructure development, and educational initiatives. 

This focus on open research and collaboration promotes the following:
Continuous innovation and improvement within the ecosystem.
Sharing knowledge and resources to accelerate the development and adoption of decentralized governance models.
collaboration between diverse stakeholders, fostering a more inclusive and resilient ecosystem.
### 8.9 Exchange Mechanism: Metagora Exchange
Metagora Access Card holders can exchange AGT to DMT at 1:1, with DMT tokens locked in the Metagora Access Card upon conversion. 

This exchange mechanism:
i. Allows a seamless transition between utility and governance tokens.
ii. Encourages active participation in the governance process, as users can directly convert their utility tokens into voting power.
### 8.10 Exit Mechanism and Penalties: Hermes' Escape
Members can liquidate DMT tokens within a Metagora Access Card, incurring a penalty based on the time remaining on the lock. The penalty ranges from 0% to 60% of the tokens, decreasing linearly as the time lock decreases. 

The exit mechanism:
i. Encourages long-term commitment to the ecosystem by penalizing premature exits.
ii. Ensures that those who leave the ecosystem early contribute a portion of their tokens back to the community treasury.
8.11 Summary
To summarize, we purposefully designed the tokenomics of Decentragora to foster a thriving ecosystem using a solid economic foundation that incentivizes positive-sum behaviour, collaboration, and sustainable practices. The dual-token system, staking mechanisms, and various economic game models create a robust, dynamic and resilient environment for decentralized governance and regenerative culture.

The Decentragora tokenomics model encourages open research, collaboration, and continuous evolution by embracing decentralized governance and regenerative practices. Furthermore, the model is adaptive and subject to change via governance proposals, ensuring that the ecosystem can evolve and adapt to the needs of its participants and the broader community.
